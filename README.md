Starting the Game:

Decide who goes first by any mutual agreement or coin toss.

Player's Turn:
On a player's turn, they roll a single die.
The player can continue rolling the die as many times as they like during their turn.
Rolling the Die:

If the die rolls any number other than 1, the player adds the rolled number to their turn's score.
The player then decides whether to:
Roll again: Continue rolling the die to accumulate more points for the turn.
Hold: Add the points accumulated during the turn to their total score and end their turn.

Rolling a 1:
If the die rolls a 1, the player's turn ends immediately.
They lose all points accumulated during that turn, and no points are added to their total score.
The turn then passes to the other player.

Holding:
When a player chooses to hold, their turn's accumulated points are added to their total score.
The turn then passes to the other player.

Winning the Game:
The game continues with players alternating turns until one player's total score reaches or exceeds 50 points.
The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game.

Strategy:
Players must decide how many times to roll the die each turn. Rolling more can yield higher points but comes with the risk of rolling a 1 and losing the turn's points.
Holding at the right moment can prevent losing points to a roll of 1, but might also mean missing out on potentially higher scores.

Enjoy playing Pig!
