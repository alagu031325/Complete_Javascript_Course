https://alagu-forkify.netlify.app/ - This is an online recipe web application - where we can search from list of recipies taken from the api 'https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/api/v2/recipes/' - and we can also add new recipes, bookmark our favorite recipes and increase/decrease the servinds to update the ingredients

https://alagu-pig-game.netlify.app/ - Two player game, the first player can keep rolling the dice and adds up the point if one rolls on the dice then the chance will shift to the second player, if we like to add our points to the final score we need to hold the points, holding it soon will change the chance to the second player or holder it too late will lead to lose the points if the dice is rolled to one, the players who holds 50 points at the end will be the winner 

https://alagu-mapty.netlify.app/ - While using this mapty application kindly allow the location access to set the map in the current location - then we can click anywhere on the map to add our running or cycling minutes and to keep track of our physical activities
